      "bio": "Queen of the household, Miss Peregrine commands respect with her elegant tuxedo coat and dignified demeanor. While she may appear standoffish at first glance, this senior feline harbors a heart of gold beneath her formal exterior. Her regal presence is so powerful that even the border collie knows better than to challenge her authority. When not supervising her domain from carefully selected perches, Ms Peregrine might grace a lucky human with her rare but meaningful displays of affection. A true tech companion who appreciates order and precision, she silently judges code quality from a distance while maintaining her aristocratic composure.",

His snowshoe coat and mesmerizing blue eyes make him a vision of feline beauty, drawing admiring glances but rarely seeking attention. This reserved gentleman saves his rare but treasured purrs for special occasions, turning each rumble into a memorable event worth celebrating. While he generally keeps to himself, Salem has formed an unbreakable bond with our youngest daughter, his chosen human. Nothing brings him more joy than a small bowl of milk, which he savors with delicate appreciation. Though not one for the spotlight, this soft, cuddly sweetheart brings a gentle presence to the household tech scene, offering silent companionship to our daughter as she navigates the digital world.",

This fearless feline brings vibrant energy to our home, with a mischievous spirit that finds particular joy in stalking Miss Peregrine through windows, much to the elder cat's dismay. Despite her fierce reputation, Samurai melts at the promise of a good scratch, frequently interrupting coding sessions by leaping onto my desk to demand immediate attention and cuddles. Her sudden keyboard inspections might seem like affection, but perhaps she's actually conducting rigorous code reviews, her amber eyes scanning for bugs with the same intensity she once faced down those canine adversaries. Equal parts tenacious fighter and loving companion, Samurai proves daily that the smallest packages often contain the boldest spirits.",

A true master of relaxation, he spent most of his days napping in the warmest spots he could find, only taking breaks to bring us the occasional “gift” in the form of an unfortunate mouse. With his signature don't care attitude, he ruled the house with quiet authority, never once bothering to impress anyone—but somehow managing to steal our hearts anyway. Rest well, Poocha.
